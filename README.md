My Personal Portfolio Page includes sections for your home, about, resume, projects, and contact information. I've reviewed it and it appears well-structured and visually appealing.

1. **Title and Typing Animation**:
    - I have implemented a typing animation for the text "Student". However, if you wish to add more texts to this animation, you might want to include them in the `typingTexts` array and adjust the animation logic.

2. **Skills Section**:
    - The skills section under "About Me" could be further customized to reflect more skills or different proficiency levels if needed.

3. **Experience and Education**:
    - I have listed my experiences and education in a clear and concise manner. Consider adding more details or bullet points if there are additional highlights you'd like to showcase.

4. **Projects Section**:
    - The project descriptions are detailed and well-written. Ensure that the links to your GitHub or GitLab projects are correct.

5. **Contact Section**:
    - All contact information appears accurate. Ensure the links for phone and email are clickable and correctly formatted.

6. **Footer**:
    - Ensure your footer is closing properly with the `</div></div></footer>` tags.
